"Values shown for maximum AFDC/TANF cash benefits for families of 2, 3, and 4 persons (Columns P, Q, & R) do not take the state's majority rule calculation into consideration for 1980-2005.  This is consistent with collection methods used by the Congressional Research Service and the Ways and Means Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, which record maximum benefits received within the state. There is variation across states on what constitutes majority rule, which affects how states' maximum TANF cash benefits are recorded for recipient families.  2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 values come from the Urban Institute's Welfare Rules Database.  These years do take majority rule into consideration.  ",,,,,,,,
