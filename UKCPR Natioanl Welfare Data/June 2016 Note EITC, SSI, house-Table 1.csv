"Values for state EITC rates (column BA) were updated due to minor inconsistencies in historic rates.  Values should reflect rates reported by the Tax Policy Center (http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/taxfacts/content/PDF/state_eitc.pdf).

Values for state SSI rates (column AF) were updated.  Reported rates derive from the ""Living Independently"" category reported by the Social Security Administration.  Some states have alternative definitions for ""Living Independently"" (""Independent Community Living"" in CT).  Rates were updated to ensure consistency across states. Other values were updated due to minor inconsistencies in historic rates.  Values should reflect rates reported by the SSA (https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/ssi_st_asst/).

Values for Number in Lower House Republican (column AM) were updated.  A typo caused cells to be shifted for the year 1996.  These cells were corrected.  This also affects the values in the Fraction of State House that is Democrat field (column AN).  Other values were updated due to minor inconsistencies in historic rates. Values should reflect numbers reported by the Council of State Governments (http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/category/content-type/bos-archive).
